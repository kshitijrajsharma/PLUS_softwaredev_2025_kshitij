Hello! Here it goes:
- one quotation you like: “Don't be an idiot. Before I do anything I ask myself, 'Would an idiot do that? ' And if the answer is yes, I do not do that thing.” Dwight Schrute
- a food or flavour you don‘t like: I hate avocado
- a recommendation for something and why: I recommend you to buy a bike in salzburg because it's the best and fastest way to move around the city :)
- one German language word you have learned, or think is useful for others to know: Schneeballschlacht
